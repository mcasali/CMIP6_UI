<div mat-dialog-content><h3>Statistical Downscaling</h3>
  <em>Statistical downscaling</em> is a process of developing statistical relationships between local climate
  variables (e.g., surface air temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields),
  and the application of such relationships to the output of Global Climate Model experiments to simulate local
  climate characteristics in the future. The monthly simulations of air temperature and precipitation have been
  downscaled with the following steps: 1) using an off-the-shelf method to provide an initial estimate at every
  prediction location from the CCSM4 data; 2) determining a simple linear model for every location in the
  prediction domain; and 3) applying the linear model to the initial estimate to produce the final downscaled
  estimate. The downscaling process used here critically depends upon the PRISM climate mapping system, developed
  at Oregon State University. Spatial resolution of downscaled CCSM4 projections of temperature and precipitation
  for the contiguous USA is 4.5 km. More information about this downscaling method can be found in this <a
