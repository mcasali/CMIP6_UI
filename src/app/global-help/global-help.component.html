<h1 mat-dialog-title>The Community Climate System Model (CCSM)</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>Global climate simulations were produced at NCAR for the 6th Assessment report of the IPCC.
  Composed of five separate models simultaneously simulating the earth's atmosphere, ocean, land, land ice and sea-ice,
  and one central coupler component that passes information between the components. CESM allows researchers to study the
  earth's past, present and future climate states. Climate simulations from the CESM are generated on a Gaussian grid,
  where each grid point can be uniquely accessed by one-dimensional latitude and longitude arrays (i.e. the coordinates
  are orthogonal). In the CESM model output, the longitudes are equally spaced at 1.25ยบ, while the latitudes vary in
  spacing slightly around 0.95ยบ. Therefore, the approximate spatial resolution of global climate projections is 105 km.
  Because of the irregular grid in the CESM model, this portal distributes data in a point format, where each point
  represents a centroid of a corresponding CESM grid cell. A shapefile of irregular rectangular polygons of the original
  model output is also available.</div>
