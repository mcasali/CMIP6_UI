  Several temporal aggregations of projected climate can be downloaded from this portal.
  <br><br /><strong>Monthly Mean</strong><br/>
    Monthly mean values are available for all variables and all SSPs/ all ensembles. You can select all months for 1
  year or one month for a range of years.
  <br><br /><strong>Annual Mean</strong><br/>
    Annual mean values have been calculated from monthly model outputs. The values are averaged (or summed, for
  precipitation) for the entire year (January-December) and show annual average climatological conditions.
  <br><br /><strong>20-Year Mean</strong><br/>
    20-year mean values have been calculated for both monthly and annual data. 20-year means &quot;smooth out&quot; single
  extreme events. 20-year mean values are useful for analyzing long term climate trends.
  <br><br/>To download a 20-year mean, enter the middle year in the 20-year time period. For example, by entering &quot;2050&quot;, you will
  download the 20-year mean of 2040-2059.
  <br><br /><strong>Anomaly</strong><br/>
    Anomaly, in climate science, is a deviation of a meteorological variable from the normal (mean) value (here, we use
  present day climate, 1995-2014, as the normal). Determining this anomaly is best accomplished by taking an average
  over multiple ensemble members, and also by averaging over multiple years within each ensemble average. In climate
  models, internal variability in the climate system is expressed both as year-to-year variability and as differences
  between ensemble members. It is helpful to have a large number of data points included in the average for both the
  present-day and future climates when computing an anomaly. For example, an anomaly can be calculated by comparing
  (subtracting) an ensemble average of present-day climate simulations (i.e., Historical; 1995-2014) from an ensemble
  average of future climate simulations (e.g., RCP 6.0; 2080-2099).
  <br><br/>The anomalies have been computed for a multi-year mean of monthly and annual data.
  <br><br/>To download a climate anomaly, enter start and end years. For example, by entering &quot;2050&quot; as both start year and end
  year, you will download the climate anomaly between 2050 (2040-2059 mean) and the present day climate (1995-2014 mean).
  By entering a range of years, for example, &quot;start year = 2050/end year = 2070&quot;, you will download 20 years of climate
  anomalies, where each year is a 20-year mean compared to present day climate.
