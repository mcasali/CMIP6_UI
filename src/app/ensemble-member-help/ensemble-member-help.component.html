<div mat-dialog-content>Choosing Climate Model Runs<br><br/>
  Climate modelers employ a technique called ensembling to capture the range of possible climate states. An ensemble
  is a collection of model experiments of the same climate model, using the exact same physics, which differ slightly in their
  initial conditions. The different initial conditions results in different simulations for each ensemble member
  due to the nonlinearity of the climate system. Individual model  experiments are called ensemble members, and the average
  is the ensemble average. Comparing the variation among ensemble members gives an estimate of the uncertainty
  associated with internal climate variability (IPCC 2007 WG-I Annex, p.945), while averaging the members
  gives a measure of the average model response to the imposed forcings.<br><br/>
  Choose an ensemble member (<mark>Run 10</mark>, for example) if you want specific experiment data or you would like to compare multiple
  runs in order to measure variability in the model.
  <br><br/>
  Choose the Ensemble Average if you want the <mark>mean state of the climate</mark> among all model experiments.
