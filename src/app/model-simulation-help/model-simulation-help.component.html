  Scenarios have been used in global change research for four decades. The latest version of scenarios, used for CMIP6
  and presented in IPCC AR6, are based on a set of Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). These SSP-based scenarios
  combine narratives of societal development over the next century (the SSPs) with the Representative Concentration
  Pathways (RPCs). While the SSPs describe alternative futures about development, population, urbanization, economy
  and technology, the RPCs describe trajectories of change in atmospheric greenhouse gasses and aerosol concentrations
  over time. The figure below shows different combinations of socioeconomic development pathways (SSPs) and climate
  outcomes (e.g., warming) based on a particular pathway for greenhouse gas concentrations.<br><br>

  Five SSPs available here represent different futures and widely varying climate mitigation and adaptation challenges.<br><br>

  SSP5-8.5 is based on the Fossil-Fueled Development storyline and represents the high end of the range of future
  pathways, corresponding to RCP8.5. <br>
  SSP3-7.0 represents the medium to high end of the range of future forcing pathways. <br>
  SSP2-4.5 represents the medium part of the range of future forcing pathways and updates RCP4.5.
  SSP4-3.4 fills in the range of low forcing pathways, and there is substantial mitigation policy
  interest in this scenario that reaches 3.4 W m–2 by 2100.<br>
  SSP1-2.6 is similar to RCP2.6. It is anticipated that it will produce a multi-model mean of less than 2°C warming
  by 2100.<br><br>


  SSP1: Sustainability - SSP1-2.6<br>
  SSP2: Middle of the Road - SSP2-4.5<br>
  SSP3: Regional Rivalry - SSP3-7.0<br>
  SSP5: SSP5-8.5<br><br>

  These scenarios vary with regard to the challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. As seen in the figure
  below SSP1 and SSP5 are relatively optimistic and differ in that SSP1 consists of a future that shifts towards
  sustainable practices while SSP5 assumes an energy-intense future based on fossil fuels. SSP3 and SSP4 are more
  pessimistic futures for human development with little investment in education and health.  SSP2 is a middle of
  the road scenario.  <br><br/>
